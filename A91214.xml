            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I an≈øwer, That this Po≈øition (an Oracle of their own forging,
not of Gods inditing) is as fal≈øe as God is true. For 1. There are two
≈øorts of Promi≈øes or Covenants of Grace conteined in the Scriptures. 1. Of
working, begetting in, or giving, conferring a New heart, ≈øpirit, and all
nece≈ø≈øary ≈øaving Graces, to tho≈øe who never had them: 2ly, Of
confirming, encrea≈øing, renewing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating Graces when and where they
are already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; commonly thus di≈øtingui≈øhed: <hi>Promi≈øes of Grace,
and Promi≈øes to Grace.</hi> The fir≈øt of the≈øe Promi≈øes and Covenants
(being general, univer≈øal, indefinite) were made <hi>to men, not only before
their calling and conver≈øion, but before their very births and being in the
world; witne≈øs Gods Covenant, Promi≈øes made to the ≈øeed of Abraham;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:168499:8"/> 
               <hi>and for the calling, conver≈øion, ≈øalvation of the
Gentiles,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years before their fulfilling, recorded at large,
Gen. 17.1. to 17. Acts 2.38,39. Ho≈ø. 1.10. c.2.23. Rom. 9.25,26. c.
11.26.30,31.15. c.15.8. to 24. I≈øa. 52.15. Eph. 2.1,2,5,11. to 24. I≈øa.
42.1.6. c.60.3,4,5, c.62.2.11,12. c.66.19,20,21. P≈øal. 72.4. to 18. Yea the
promi≈øes and new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant forementioned (of which our Antagoni≈øts affirm
the Lords Supper to be a <hi>Seal</hi>) <hi>were made to ≈øuch, who had no
≈øaving Grace, no new heart, spirit. or ≈øanctification at all in them, but
were desperately ≈øinfull, gracele≈øs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and dead in ≈øins and
tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, when made unto them,</hi> as is evident by Jer. 31.31,33,34.

Therefore if the≈øe Promi≈øes and Covenants of Grace were made to ≈øuch by
God him≈øelf, the Seals of the Covenant and the≈øe Promi≈øes mu≈øt al≈øo
by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence belong of right unto them; ≈øince <hi>the

to which they are annexed, even as tho≈øe who have a right to any human
Charters, Deeds, Feofments, Covenants, Obligations, have a right unto the

If but one or two ≈øinners then in an age have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and brought to

            <p>1. How can the≈øe pretending omni≈øcients po≈øitively

Since the <hi>Spirit breatheth where, when and in, by what ordinance he

that the Mini≈øters tongue only con≈øecrates, and his hands di≈øtribute the
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements, but not the Mini≈øter him≈øelf; that the Communicants
mouths onely eat and drink the bread and wine at the Lords Supper, not their

               <hi>but parts and appurtenances of this holy duty and
Ordinance,</hi> relating wholly to it; Therefore the real Grace and
conver≈øion wrought at or by it, by any part of the duties that either
nece≈ø≈øarily precede, accompanie, or follow it, may and mu≈øt be a≈øcribed
to this Sacrament, as the in≈øtrumental cau≈øe; not to the word, prayer, or
any other Ordinance alone which nece≈ø≈øarily attends it; as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie is
chiefly a≈øcribed to the General who commands in chief, not to the private
Soldiers who win the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel under him. 5ly, That this effect of Saving Grace
and conver≈øion, is rarely wrought at or by the Lords Supper, is now a mo≈øt
certain truth, becau≈øe the Lords Supper is ≈øo rarely admini≈øtred, yea
quite ca≈øt a≈øide for divers years in many places, and not u≈øed,
re≈øorted to as a converting Ordinance, where and when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtred: And if
the word were now as ≈øeldom preached as the Lords Supper is admini≈øtred,
few or none would or could be converted by it. But when the Lords Supper was
daily, weekly or monethly admini≈øtred, as in the Apo≈øtles times, the
Primitive Church and former daies, then many were ordinarily, frequently
convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, as well as confirmed, whereas not one Soul hath been either
converted or confirmed, by being debarred from it for divers years together,
but many hindred from conver≈øion, edification, confirmation, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168499:14"/> qui e de≈øtroied. 6ly, Very few have been converted by
the word preached, ≈øince this Sacrament hath been di≈øcontinued and decried,
as we find by ≈øad experience. The raritie therefore of Converts at and by
this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeds only from the infrequencie and di≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of it as
a Converting, faith-engendring Ordinance; not from its indi≈øpo≈øition or
incongruity to work both faith, and conver≈øion. 7ly, That the Lords Supper
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects grace and conver≈øion only extraordinarily, and by accident, as
temptations, afflictions, ≈øickne≈ø≈øes, &amp;c. do, not as a proper
in≈øtrument or means ordained, ble≈ø≈øed by God for ≈øuch effects, is a
mo≈øt ab≈øurd, unchri≈øtian, untheological, erronious, if not blafphemous
a≈ø≈øertion, contrarie to Scripture, Antiquity, the current of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
