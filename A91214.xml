            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Occaſion</hi> of penning this <hi>Publication,</hi> was a late
<hi>Act-Queſtion,</hi> and a <hi>Sermon</hi> which I heard this laſt
Vacation; The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal motive exciting me thereunto, was this <hi>ſad
Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> That though <hi>ſundry Miniſters</hi> in moſt parts

this their <hi>Anti-Sacramental, abſurd,</hi> impious <hi>Paradox</hi> had

two precedent, is this, <hi>That thoſe have no right to, nor intereſt in
the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, who have no prae-exiſtent ſaving Grace, and faith
within them: Therefore to adminiſter the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſuch, is but to

in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That this Poſition (an Oracle of their own forging,
not of Gods inditing) is as falſe as God is true. For 1. There are two
ſorts of Promiſes or Covenants of Grace conteined in the Scriptures. 1. Of
working, begetting in, or giving, conferring a New heart, ſpirit, and all
neceſſary ſaving Graces, to thoſe who never had them: 2ly, Of
confirming, encreaſing, renewing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating Graces when and where they
are already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; commonly thus diſtinguiſhed: <hi>Promiſes of Grace,
and Promiſes to Grace.</hi> The firſt of theſe Promiſes and Covenants
(being general, univerſal, indefinite) were made <hi>to men, not only before
their calling and converſion, but before their very births and being in the
world; witneſs Gods Covenant, Promiſes made to the ſeed of Abraham;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:168499:8"/> 
               <hi>and for the calling, converſion, ſalvation of the
Gentiles,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years before their fulfilling, recorded at large,
Gen. 17.1. to 17. Acts 2.38,39. Hoſ. 1.10. c.2.23. Rom. 9.25,26. c.
11.26.30,31.15. c.15.8. to 24. Iſa. 52.15. Eph. 2.1,2,5,11. to 24. Iſa.
42.1.6. c.60.3,4,5, c.62.2.11,12. c.66.19,20,21. Pſal. 72.4. to 18. Yea the
promiſes and new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant forementioned (of which our Antagoniſts affirm
the Lords Supper to be a <hi>Seal</hi>) <hi>were made to ſuch, who had no
ſaving Grace, no new heart, spirit. or ſanctification at all in them, but
were desperately ſinfull, graceleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and dead in ſins and
treſpaſſes, when made unto them,</hi> as is evident by Jer. 31.31,33,34.
c.32.37, to 44. Ezech. 11.18,19,20. c.36.25,26,27. Heb. 8.6. to 13. c.10.16,17.
Therefore if theſe Promiſes and Covenants of Grace were made to ſuch by
God himſelf, the Seals of the Covenant and theſe Promiſes muſt alſo
by neceſſary conſequence belong of right unto them; ſince <hi>the
acceſſory alwayes follows the principal,</hi> and the Seals the Covenants
to which they are annexed, even as thoſe who have a right to any human

to prove, warrant the power of Miniſters, Presbyteries, Claſſes, Triers
to examin the Lives, knowledge, faith, Graces, fitnes, worthineſs of
Communicants, before they be admitted to the Lords Supper: their ſecluding
any Churchmembers from it for ignorance, ſcandal, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs, or any
other incapacity, not excluding them alike from all other Ordinances: their
peremptory <pb n="16" facs="tcp:168499:11"/> refuſal to adminiſter this Sacrament to
whole Pariſhes, Cities for ſundry year: their denying it to viſible
Saints for fear others ſhould crowd into it if adminiſtred: or their
gathering new ſelected Conventicles out of old parcchial Congregations, Yet,
the Objectors affirm all theſe to be of divine inſtitution, agreeable to
the will, mind of Jeſus Chriſt, which they muſt have onely by ſpecial
revelation, having no Scripture proof at all to clear it. 3ly, There is no
direct preſident in Scripture to prove reading of the Scripture, Meditation,
Faſting, Prayer, Singing of Pſalms, repetition of Sermons, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties,
converting, Grace-infuſing Ordinances; yet there is ſufficient Ground in,
and abnndance of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Examples out of Scripture to prove them to be
ſuch. 4ly, There is no expreſs preſident in ſacred writ for the
baptiſm of Infants born of Chriſtian Parents, but only by way of
neceſſary conſequence: The like may be ſaid of the Lords day Sabbath,
Payment of Tithes under the Goſpel; Preparation Sermons for the Lords Supper,

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:168499:12"/> 
               <hi>is joy in heaven in the preſence of God and his
Angels over one ſinner that repenteth, and is converted,</hi> Luke 15.7.10.
If but one or two ſinners then in an age have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and brought to
repentance at or by the Lords Supper, ſhould not this engage all Miniſters
frequently to adminiſter it even to unconverted Sinners, becauſe
poſſibly ſome one of them may be converted by it; and ſo cauſe joy in
heaven before the Angels, as well as bring glory to God and this his Ordinance
upon earth. Yea will not this wilfull debarring their people from this their
Monthly food and phyſick, bring perpetual horror, lamentation upon many
Miniſters in Hell, and ſeclude them from eternal joies in Heaven, if any
one ſoul under their charge ſhall periſh, ſtarve, miſcarry for want
of this ſpiritual food and cordial? 5. It is Gods own reſolution, precept,
Rom. 14.15. <hi>If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not
according to Charity; Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt
died.</hi> Are there not many thouſands of people now juſtly grieved with
their Miniſters, for denying them this their ſpiritual meat, phyſick,
year after year, which they daily, monthly cry for at their hands, &amp; yet
cannot receive it? and do not they then as much as in them is, <hi>deſtroy
and ſtarve thoſe for whom Chriſt died,</hi> by denying that Spiritual
Balm, that Soul-ſaving repaſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, bloud and death of our Lord
Jeſus, which ſhould ſave them from periſhing, and <hi>feed, preſerve
their bodies and Souls unto eternal life?</hi> Yea, do they not herein deal
moſt tyrannically, unchriſtianly, inhumanly, unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably with their
people, not <hi>walking according to the rule of charity?</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 24.45,46. Lu. 12.42, &amp;c.</note>
And can they then expect the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of that <hi>juſt and
faithfull Servant, whom the Lord hath made ruler over his houſhold, to give
them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> when as they detain this
chief portion of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food and heavenly Supper from them againſt his
precept? Or can they eſcape <hi>that cutting aſſunder, and portion with
unbelievers,</hi> Chriſt there threatens to that <hi>evil Servant,</hi> who
<hi>injured his fellow Servants, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> 
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:168499:13"/>
               <hi>them of their due portion of food?</hi> I fear they can doe neither,
unleſs they repent of this Soul-ſtarving cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus much in anſwer
only to their conceſſion, <hi>That ſome are, and may be converted at or
by the Lords Supper.</hi> I ſhall now reply to their evaſions.</p>
            <p>1. How can theſe pretending omniſcients poſitively
determine, that ſuch who have been converted at the Lords Supper, <hi>were
not converted by it,</hi> but by the word or prayers which accompanied it?
Since the <hi>Spirit breatheth where, when and in, by what ordinance he
liſteth, and they cannot tell by what way he works, especially in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hearts, whoſe perſons and means of converſion they are ignorant of,</hi>
John 3.8. 2ly, <hi>The Word of Benediction, Conſecration, Inſtitution
uſed at the Lords Supper, is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of it, without which it
neither is nor can be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> as

one from another, as diſtinct, when God hath joyned them together as
inſeparable, to make up one intire Sacrament, and to attribute converſion
to the word of benediction, conſecration or inſtitution only, but not to
the Elements and intire Ordinance, is as great an abſurdity as to affirm;
that the Miniſters tongue only conſecrates, and his hands diſtribute the
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements, but not the Miniſter himſelf; that the Communicants
mouths onely eat and drink the bread and wine at the Lords Supper, not their
perſons; or, thar the Uſes of Sermons convert the Auditors, not the
Doctrines, Motives, or intire Sermons. 3ly, This <hi>Sacrament is both a</hi>

               <hi>but parts and appurtenances of this holy duty and
Ordinance,</hi> relating wholly to it; Therefore the real Grace and
converſion wrought at or by it, by any part of the duties that either
neceſſarily precede, accompanie, or follow it, may and muſt be aſcribed
to this Sacrament, as the inſtrumental cauſe; not to the word, prayer, or
any other Ordinance alone which neceſſarily attends it; as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie is
chiefly aſcribed to the General who commands in chief, not to the private
Soldiers who win the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel under him. 5ly, That this effect of Saving Grace
and converſion, is rarely wrought at or by the Lords Supper, is now a moſt
certain truth, becauſe the Lords Supper is ſo rarely adminiſtred, yea
quite caſt aſide for divers years in many places, and not uſed,
reſorted to as a converting Ordinance, where and when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: And if
the word were now as ſeldom preached as the Lords Supper is adminiſtred,
few or none would or could be converted by it. But when the Lords Supper was
daily, weekly or monethly adminiſtred, as in the Apoſtles times, the
Primitive Church and former daies, then many were ordinarily, frequently
convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, as well as confirmed, whereas not one Soul hath been either
converted or confirmed, by being debarred from it for divers years together,
but many hindred from converſion, edification, confirmation, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168499:14"/> qui e deſtroied. 6ly, Very few have been converted by
the word preached, ſince this Sacrament hath been diſcontinued and decried,
as we find by ſad experience. The raritie therefore of Converts at and by
this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeds only from the infrequencie and diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of it as
a Converting, faith-engendring Ordinance; not from its indiſpoſition or
incongruity to work both faith, and converſion. 7ly, That the Lords Supper
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects grace and converſion only extraordinarily, and by accident, as
temptations, afflictions, ſickneſſes, &amp;c. do, not as a proper
inſtrument or means ordained, bleſſed by God for ſuch effects, is a
moſt abſurd, unchriſtian, untheological, erronious, if not blafphemous
aſſertion, contrarie to Scripture, Antiquity, the current of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
Proteſtants or Papiſts, forein or domeſtick, and the very
<hi>Directory</hi> it ſelf, which ſtiles it, A MEANS OF GRACE, as well as

            <p>I anſwer, 1. That the ſequel of the Major is falſe: 1.
Becauſe the Lords Supper belongs not to meer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Heathens and
Idolaters, (being not inſtituted by Chriſt for ſuch, to convert them from
Paganiſm to Chriſtianity) but only to baptized Chriſtians and Members of
the viſible Church; as is evident by Mat. 26.17. to 33. Mat. 14.12. to 28.
Lu. 22.8. to 31. c.24.30,31. Acts 2.41,42,46. c.20.7.11. 1 Cor. 10.16,17.21.

were <hi>uncircumciſed,</hi> but to the <hi>circumciſed alone,</hi> Exod.
12.43. to 50. and the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was to be adminiſtred
to no meer <hi>Pagans, but only to ſuch who embraced the Goſpel</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:168499:15"/>

Now the reaſon why neither the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> nor <hi>Baptiſm</hi>

Supper or Baptiſm to ſuch, before they embrace and believe the Goſpel
preached. 3ly, Becauſe competent knowledge, and an hiſtorical belief at
leaſt of the death, paſſion, merits of Chriſt, and of the matter, ends
of the Lords Supper (as the Objectors and

Rites are adorned, which we call, the Sacraments of the new Law, becauſe</hi>

<hi>SACRENT NOS ET SANCTOS REDDANT, they might ſanctifie and make us holy, as
well in conſcience as in the fleſh. Whence it may be collected, that to
thoſe who receive them worthily,</hi> Sanctificationem et ſalutem parari,
<hi>they procure both ſanctification and ſalvation. A Sacrament therefore,
from the custom of the Catholike Church, is called,</hi> An external and
ſenſible ſign of a ſacred <pb n="28" facs="tcp:168499:17"/> thing, with an effectual
ſignification, <hi>inſinuating or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying (as inſtrumental cauſes,

<hi>Theſe Sacraments were inſtituted by Chriſt for the remedy and cure of

<q rend="inline">"He was wounded for our transgreſſions, he was

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168499:25"/> we are buried with him in baptiſm, that like as Chriſt
was raiſed up from the dead, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs
of life: For if we have been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in the likneſs of his death,

that our old man is crucified with him, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of ſinne might be

die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lords;
For TO THIS END Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be
Lord both of quick and dead. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.20. I am dead to the Law, that
I might live unto God, I am crucified with Chriſt; Nevertheleſs I live, yet

<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14,15. That Chriſt through death might deſtroy him that had
the power of death, that is, the Devil, and deliver them, who through fear of
death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.
Chriſt died for all, that they which live ſhould not live unto

            <p>12ly, It is moſt evident, both by Scripture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that the ſeeing, beholding of things with our eyes, doth more immediately,
